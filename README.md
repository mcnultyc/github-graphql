In order to run our program, we assume that Intellij is installed and working in order to import the project.

Our program can be run via two methods:

1. By using the run button in IntellJ.   

2. With SBT by using the commands: 'sbt clean', 'sbt compile', and 'sbt run'. 

In order to run our tests, you must use SBT and the command: 'sbt run test'
